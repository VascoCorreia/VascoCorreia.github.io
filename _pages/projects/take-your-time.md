### Overview
Take Your Time was the first game I ever developed! It is a 2D shooter scroller where you play as Yawn.

You must travel a total of 300 units to win without allowing the time to end, while avoiding the enemies and collecting power ups! 

### Lore
When Yawn is almost falling asleep in his sofa he remembers all the responsibilities he should have tackled a long time ago. Already in a dreamy state, Yawn has a nightmare where he must fight his greatest enemies: Procrastination and Laziness.

In this nightmare his enemies take form as evil clocks and pillow, you must help Yawn escape unscathed from this nightmare in order to get up  and go tackle his responsibilities.

Developed using Love2d framework that utilizes Lua as its scripting language.
