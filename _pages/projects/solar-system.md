### Overview

My Solar system gravity simulator. All celestial bodies in the simulation move according to Newtons gravitation law that states:  

*Newton's law of universal gravitation is usually stated as that every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.*   
{: .notice--primary}  
This said, every celestial bodies is influenced and influences all other celestial bodies depending on the gravitational constant, their masses and the distance to each other.  
The simulation starts using a normal time scale but can be sped up to a maximum value of 1 year per second.  

It includes our beautifull star and all the planets in the solar system!  

Everything is scaled except the planet diameters.

### Controls  

The player can move the camera in 2 different ways:
- WASD keys (faster)
- Right click mouse + mouse scroll wheel (more precise)  

To Rotate camera:
- Right click + mouse movement
