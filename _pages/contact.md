## Education

My educational journey began at Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa (ISEL), where I studied Electrical, Communication, and Computer Engineering for two years. However, during that time, I realized that something was missing for me in that particular degree.  

After careful consideration, I made a bold decision to change my course of study to pursue something that truly brought me joy. That's when I embarked on the path of Games and Apps Development at the Faculty of Design, Technology, and Communication (Iade), and graduated in 2023 and I have never looked back since.

In this new field of study, I found the perfect blend of my logical thinking abilities and my passion for creativity. It was a refreshing change that allowed me to engage my mind in a way that resonated with my interests.
